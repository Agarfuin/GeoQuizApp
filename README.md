# University of Bradford COS7025-B Mobile Application Development Final Couserwork Project

This repository consists of an android native application project source code.

The project is about a geography quiz application where there are 2 parts per question:

## Multiple Choice

This part is fairly simple. There is an image shown in the screen and there are 4 options of different countries. The user tries to know which of the countries does the shown image is related to.

## Country Location

If the user's answer on the first part(multiple choice) correctly, then this part starts. This time the user tries to find the selected country in the first part and locate it on the map.

There are 40 questions in total and if the user answers both of the parts correctly then the question for that country gets deleted from the database.

If not, the question stays inside the database and it will appear again in the future.

Have fun!
